[Annotation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html)
Annotations do not directly affect program semantics, 
but they do affect the way programs are treated by tools and libraries, 
which can in turn affect the semantics of the running program. 
Annotations can be read from source files, class files, or reflectively at run time.
